# Homework 3A

Open ``exercise_air_quality.ipynb`` and complete the questions there, within the notebook.

Commit the notebook file and push your changes to github in order to start the autograding workflow and receive a grade.
Unlimited attempts: feel free to push further changes to github to launch the autograding workflow again and again, until you receive the final grade.

The figures will be graded separately, as part of Homework-3B where you will be publishing your notebook as a webpage.

You may as usual run the tests locally to verify your answers before pushing changes to github (recommended, much faster):

```
pytest
```
or
```
python -m pytest
```

Test files of the form ``test_***.py`` and the ``.github`` directory should not be altered.
